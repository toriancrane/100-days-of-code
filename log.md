# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jumped back into FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I'd done some of the challenges in the middle of last year but then eventually fizzled out. I want to commit to both the 100 day challenge and the completion of FCCs certifications.  I am going to try and commit an average of two hours a day to coding.
