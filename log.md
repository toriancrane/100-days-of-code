# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jumped back into FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I'd done some of the challenges in the middle of last year but then eventually fizzled out. I want to commit to both the 100 day challenge and the completion of FCCs certifications. My goal was to try and get into a programming job in under a year because that is the optimal path for me. It would still allow for me to pursue a grad degree in Software Engineering, but my career wouldn't necessarily be dependent upon that degree.
